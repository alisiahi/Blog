# Blog
This blog is a personal project of mine that I have deployed on a server for easy access. It is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that makes it easy to build web applications quickly and efficiently. For the front-end I used MDBootstrap templates.
The blog features a clean and minimalist design, with a focus on readability and usability. It is fully responsive, meaning that it looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones. The blog also includes a commenting system, which allows readers to leave their thoughts and feedback on my posts.
Readers can also share blog post by emailing them.
If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free contact me directly.
