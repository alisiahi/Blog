# Blog
<p>This blog is a personal project of mine that I have deployed on a server for easy access. It is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that makes it easy to build web applications quickly and efficiently. For the front-end I used MDBootstrap templates.</p>
<p>The blog features a clean and minimalist design, with a focus on readability and usability. It is fully responsive, meaning that it looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones. The blog also includes a commenting system, which allows readers to leave their thoughts and feedback on my posts.</p>
<p>Readers can also share blog post by emailing them.</P>
<p>If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free contact me directly.</p>
